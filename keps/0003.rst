KEP 3: Authorization
====================

Overview
--------
Support fine grained authorization.

Rationale
---------
Karaage 2.7 used the Django authorization system, that allowed fine grained
permissions for every user. This was a mess, with many permissions and no way
for administrator's to determine which permissions were implemented, and which
permissions did what.

This was removed in Karaage 3 when the django.contrib.auth db models where
replaced with custom db models that considerably decreased the complexities of
the previous db model.

Since then however, several Karaage administrators have expressed the need to
have a fine grained authorization system, and this needs to be reintroduced in
a clean manner.

Implementation
--------------

.. todo:

   We need to work out what the use cases are for fine grained systems, and
   what rights need to be controlled with fine grained permissions.
