KEP 2: Python 3
===============

:Created: 2014-06-30
:Author: Brian May
:Status: Draft


Overview
--------
Support Python 2 and Python 3.

Rationale
---------
Python 2.7 is in bug fix mode, and not being further developed. We need
to support Python 3 if we want ensure Karaage remains relevant.

Implementation
--------------
Beforce we can start, we need to ensure that there are Debian python3 packages
of all the relevant libraries.

* python3-django-south: Will be included in Django 1.7, which will be released
  soon.
* python3-alogger
* python3-ajax-select
* python3-django-celery
* python3-django-jsonfield - see http://bugs.debian.org/753462
* python3-django-model-utils
* python3-flup
* python3-matplotlib
* python3-mysqldb

There might be other dependancies that have been missed.

For each package, we need to:

* All required libraries have also been updated.
* Ensure code is compatable with Python 2.7, Python 3.2 and Python 3.4.
* Debian packages for python3.
* All tests run without failure.

Done
----
The following packages already support Python3 in Debian:

* python3-django
* python3-tldap
* python3-django-xmlrpc
* python3-pil (required by python3-django-captcha).
* python3-django-captcha

This list may be incomplete.
